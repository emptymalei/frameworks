## Using Our Form to Submit New Tool

We have created a form for you to submit new tools. We will regularly collect the results and integrate them into our website.

{{< netlify-form >}}

We pull data from this form automatically and create a [Pull Request on GitHub](https://github.com/emptymalei/frameworks/pulls). Not every tool will be merged. The unmerged tools will be shown in the list of [PRs](https://github.com/emptymalei/frameworks/pulls).
